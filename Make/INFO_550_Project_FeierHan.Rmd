### Distribution of cigarette smoking, tobacco smoking and tobacco use prevalence

-   Distribution of cigarette and tobacco prevalence are similar

```


### Correlation between cigarette and tobacco prevalence

-   Correlations are between **0.71-0.87**, which is relatively high

-   Clearly there is a positive association between cigarette and tobacco prevalence

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Make/Figures","Figure2.jpg"))
```


## Further Analysis

### Goal

1.  Investigate the association between scope of regulation on smoke-free environment and the prevalence of smoking

2.  Investigate the association between Treatment In Health Facilities and the prevalence of smoking

3.  Identify the most effective smoke-free environment regulation
